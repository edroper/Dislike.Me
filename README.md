Dislike.Me
==========
What It Is: A completely useless yet fun way to get data metrics from facebook, and possibly ruin friendships!

How It Works: We pull all your status updates from the last year until present time. We then calculate all the likes from your friends who have liked at least 2 of your posts, and sort from least amount to most.

Code is still a little rought. Not responsible for any lost friendships as a result of using this application

How To Use:

Create a new Facebook application, obtain a client id and secret, and add your variables wherever you see a PrivateSettings class respectively.

Dependencies:

JSON.net 
Bootstrap 3
jQuery
