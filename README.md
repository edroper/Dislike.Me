==========
What It Is: A completely useless yet fun way to get data metrics from facebook, and possibly ruin friendships!

How It Works: We pull all your status updates from the last year until present time. We then calculate all the likes from your friends who have liked at least 2 of your posts, and sort from least amount to most .
